                  <br><br>
                  1. Information we collect
                  <br><br>

It may include your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, the pages you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, and other details.
                  <br><br>

                  Device data<br>
                  We may also collect data about the device you’re using to access our website.

                  <br><br>

                  2. Legal bases for processing<br>

                  <br><br>
